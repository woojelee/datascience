Probability is the likelihood of an event occuring 

An event is a specific outcome 

P(A) = number of preferred outcomes / number of all outcomes 

Expected values is the average outcome mwe expect if we run an experiment many times 

experimental probabilities vs theoretical (true) probabilities 

P(A) of experiment = number of successful trials / number of all trials 

For categorical outcomes:
E(A) expected value = P(A) * n where n is the number of trials and P(A) is the theoretical probability 

For numerical outcomes:
E(X) = A*P(A) + B*P(B) + C*P(C) where A,B,C are the values in the sample space and P(A),P(B),P(C) are their respective probabilities 

We can use expected values to make predictions about the future based on past data
